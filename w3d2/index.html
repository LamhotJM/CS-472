Dear Professor Keith Levi,PhD.

requirements:

- Must have a good comment ✓
- maze works for success and failure and reset ✓
- protected namespace ✓
- unobtrusive javascript and styling ✓
- use strict ✓

 1. I spent 2 hours to finish all these assignments, try jQuery quiz (10 min)
 2. I learn how to use ternary operation in javascript return status==1? win():lose();
 3. At the first time, I just confused, how to figure out, if the mouse out from the box, then it turns out when I read API documentation (the suitable function is mouseleave_event)
 4. How to use .removeClass and addClass method are interesting, since never used before.
 5. I am trying to implement JS DOC that professor suggest in class : https://lamhotjm.github.io/w3d2/out/index.html

 Warm regards,

 Lamhot Siagian
