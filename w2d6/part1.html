Dear Professor Keith Levi,

Here my assignments part 1 (protected namespace,use strict, and esLint conventions are followed):

https://lamhotjm.github.io/W2D6/part1.html

1.1 Working with prototype
when we delete properties of the child, then the compiler will trace back to parent properties value. and if we
delete the properties of parents then it will give undefined.

1.2. Searching algorithm
I have learned about the prototype chain, prototype chain will be work from the top (parent) to the child however,
it will not work if we call children properties from parents.

1.3  Where it writes
Rabbit since Property lookup and execution are two different things.
and when executing alert(animal.full); alert(rabbit.full); only rabbit given true, however animal return undefined.

1.4. Why two hamsters are full

Why both hamsters full? is interesting since, for the first time, I was thinking that speedy hamsters will not modify
the master prototype, however, it happened. when we calling method eat from lazy. The solution also quite interesting,
because we need to declare a different stomach for each of the hamsters.
