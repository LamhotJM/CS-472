  <!-- Dear professor Keith,

 Assigment 1, i spent 2 hours to analylize:
 Dear Professor Keith Levi

- hasOwnProperty -> method capability to give the information
rather than  one object own that property or not. if we extends
from object or class, in order to give the true, then we need
to use super keyword on child constructor

- To declare static method and variable we use keyword static,
and if we want to call then we call the class name , then static method
or variable name

- private method only can be accessed from inside and private method use #,
f we inherit from CoffeeMachine, then we’ll have no direct access to #waterAmount.
We’ll need to rely on waterAmount getter/setter machine.waterAmount = 100;

- Extending built-in classes interesting since, it might be possible
we want to modify build in class, to do that we can inherit for instance
PowerArray inherits from the native Array

- Instead of, if we have one class, then we create new object,
if we want to know wether new object is instance of one class
we can used keyword instanceof, ie: rabbit instanceof Rabbit

- I also learn about mixin, that really useful if we have
more than one function that needs to combile.

Assigment 2 :
-  I learn about extends keyword
-  How to override string method
-  I Spent 2 hours to finish task II
- Completing unit test using mocha
